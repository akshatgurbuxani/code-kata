# Animal Speak Kata

A programming kata exploring programming patterns through animal behavior simulation.

## Rules

Create an implementation with Dogs and Cats that have the following attributes and behavior:

**Attributes:**
- `name` (string)
- `age` (integer)

**Behavior:**
- `speak()` - Animals introduce themselves with their sound and details

**Animals:**
- **Dogs**: Say "Ruff" and introduce themselves
- **Cats**: Say "Meow" and introduce themselves

## Example Output

```
Ruff. My name is Rex, and I am 1 year old.
Ruff. My name is Fido, and I am 6 years old.
Meow. My name is Kitty, and I am 0 years old.
Meow. My name is Sylvester, and I am 2 years old.
```

## Run

```bash
python src/oop.py
```

## Test

```bash
pytest src/test_oop.py -v
```
